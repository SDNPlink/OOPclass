Sierra Norstrom - CMPS 2143

Hi! I have no idea if anything in this folder works because I couldn't get SFML to work correctly on my laptop.  
It is entirely my fault for not reaching out for help in time as I have issues with asking for help and starting tasks in general. I am sorry about that. 
I've tried the various methods posted through the slack channel, and asking ChatGPT for help, so now I'm here.  
I can compile the files I make, but it fails to open properly, giving me the errors: 'Setting vertical sync not supported' and 'Segmentation fault (core dumped)'
What it does do, is open a blank X server up, and that's kinda it.
This occurs on even test files, but opening just a blank window only gives me the vertical sync error.  

With the dice_roll program in this (which is from github), it runs but fails to load any images, it starts with the vertical sync error then ends with the segmentation fault error

My X server works fine (I'm pretty sure), I can open xclock and xeyes and those run fine

I'm okay with getting a failing grade on this, but if it's okay, I would be interested in doing a zoom call to try and figure out what happened (permitting schedules align)
