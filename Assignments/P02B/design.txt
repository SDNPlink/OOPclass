I don't know how to make a bulleted list in github (YET!!!) so try and make it through my formatting

Dice class:
  data:
    sides, current_value
  actions:
    roll(): rolls the dice  
    get_value(): returns the value of the rolled dice
  relationships: Dice will be used by the player to roll during the game

Player class:
  data:
    name, score, dice_set, player_stats
  actions:
    roll_dice(): sends a command from the player to the dice for it to be rolled
    get_score(): retrieves the score that the player has
    update_score(points): changes the score that the player has
  relationships: Each player has a set of dice and participates in the game
    Player HAS-A Dice

Game class:
  data:
    players, rules, current_round
  actions:
    start_game(): starts a game (game running state? I guess?)
    end_game(): ends the current game
    get_winner(): returns who the winner is of the last game based on the rules
  relationships: The Game class controls the players and their actions
    Game HAS-A Player

Knucklebones class:
  data:
    board, knucklebones_specific_rules
  actions:
    start_round(): starts a round of knucklebones
    end_round(): ends a round of knucklebones
    calculate_winner(): calculates the winner of a round of knucklebones (or potentially the game)
  relationships: Inherits from Game, as Knucklebones is a game with specific rules and conditions
    Knucklebones IS-A Game
    Knuclebones HAS-A Player
